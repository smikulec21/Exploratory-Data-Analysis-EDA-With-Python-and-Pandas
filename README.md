# Guided Project: Exploratory Data Analysis with Python and Pandas

## Context
Supermarkets are experiencing significant growth in the most populated cities, leading to increased market competition. In this guided project, we will analyze a dataset that contains historical sales data from a supermarket company. This data was recorded across three different branches over a period of three months.

## Task 1: Exploring the Dataset
In this task, we will start by exploring the dataset to gain an understanding of its structure and contents.

## Task 2: Univariate Analysis
### Question 1: What does the distribution of customer ratings look like? Is it skewed?
We will analyze the distribution of customer ratings in the dataset and determine whether it exhibits any skewness.

### Question 2: Do aggregate sales numbers differ significantly between branches?
We will compare the aggregate sales numbers from each branch to identify any substantial differences.

## Task 3: Bivariate Analysis
### Question 3a: Is there a relationship between gross income and customer ratings?
We will investigate whether a relationship exists between the gross income generated and the customer ratings.

### Question 3b: Is there a relationship between branch location and gross income?
We will examine whether the branch location affects the gross income generated.

### Question 3c: Is there a relationship between gender and gross income?
We will explore the relationship between gender and gross income, if any.

### Question 4: Is there a noticeable time trend in gross income?
We will analyze the dataset for any discernible time trends in gross income over the three-month period.

## Task 4: Dealing With Duplicate Rows and Missing Values
We will address any duplicate rows and missing values in the dataset to ensure data integrity.

## Task 5: Correlation Analysis
Finally, we will perform correlation analysis to identify relationships between different variables in the dataset.

Throughout this guided project, we will use Python and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis to answer these questions and gain insights from the supermarket sales data.
